# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains the solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges. The problems are solved in TypeScript using Deno.

To run the file for a challenge, make sure you have Deno installed and in the root directory of the repo, run `deno run --watch --allow-read ./day-x/index.ts`, where the `x` in `./day-x/index.ts` is the day of the challenge you want to run. The `.in` files in each of the subdirectories represent the challenge input, and the `.test` files are example inputs.
